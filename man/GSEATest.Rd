\title{GSEA test with continuous labels}
\usage{
GSEATest(KO_index, X, Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{KO_index}{DataFrame. A table containing pair-relationship between KOs and taxa, generally is `pred_metagenome_contrib.tsv` file generated` by `PICRUst2`}

\item{X}{Matrix or DataFrame. Raw count data with samples as rows and features as columns.}

\item{Y}{Numeric vector. Labels corresponding to the samples in the data.}
}
\value{
A list containing two DataFrames:
- `Actived_KO`: Results of the GSEA analysis for case-activated KOs, including enrichment scores (ES), z-values, and p-values for each KO.
- `Suppressed_KO`: Results of the GSEA analysis for case-suppressed KOs, including enrichment scores (ES), z-values, and p-values for each KO.
